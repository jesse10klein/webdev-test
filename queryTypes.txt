Query types:

1) Direct ([stopA, stopB, stopC, ...]]) - Gets the distance of the route from stopA to stopB if it exists
2) TripsMax (stopA, stopB, maxStops) - Gets the number of trips possible from stopA to stopB with a maximum of maxStops maxStops
3) TripsExact (stopA, stopB, stops) - Gets the number of trips possible from stopA to stopB with exactly stops stops
4) ShortestLength (stopA, stopB) - Gets the minimum distance possible between stopA and stopB
5) AllPathsBelow (stopA, stopB, maxDistance) - Gets the amount of paths possible between stopA and stopB in under maxDistance distance

Example in a txt file:

1) "Direct A B C D"
2) "TripsMax A B 2"
3) "Trips Exact A B 2"
4) "ShortestLength A B"
5) "AllPathsBelow A B 30"
